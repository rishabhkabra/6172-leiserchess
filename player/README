This directory contains the codebase for the main game engine, leiserchess.
leiserchess.c: the main file that implements the UCI specification and 
               invokes everything else
eval.c: the static evaluator that implements different heuristics of the player 
move_gen: implements the board representation
search.c: implements the search routine (alpha-beta)
tt.c: implements the transposition table used by the player (a hashtable 
      storing positions seen by the player and some other relevant
      information for evaluating a position)
util: utility functions, such as random number generator, printing debugging 
      messages ... etc.
fen.c: the UCI uses the FEN notations (see description of the FEN notation in
       doc/engine-interface.txt), so the program needs to translate a FEN 
       string into the underlying board representation, and this file 
       contains that logic.
